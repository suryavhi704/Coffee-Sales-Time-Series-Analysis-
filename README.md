# ☕ Coffee Sales Time Series Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Unified Mentor Private Limited**.  
The objective was to analyze coffee sales data using **time series techniques** to identify trends, seasonality, and forecast future sales.

During the analysis, the dataset exhibited **white noise characteristics**, leading to an important analytical decision: stopping further modeling and documenting the findings.

This project highlights the importance of **data-driven decision making**, where understanding data behavior is more valuable than forcing complex models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand coffee sales behavior over time
- Perform time series preprocessing and diagnostics
- Check for stationarity, trend, and seasonality
- Identify whether the data is suitable for forecasting models

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Statsmodels  

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Date-time formatting and indexing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Stationarity checks  
5. White noise diagnostics  
6. Analytical conclusion and decision-making  

---

## 📊 Key Observations
- No significant trend or seasonality detected
- Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation showed random behavior
- Statistical tests confirmed **white noise characteristics**

---

## 🧠 Key Learning
> Not all datasets are meant for forecasting.  
> Recognizing white noise and stopping further modeling prevents overfitting and ensures analytical integrity.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Since the coffee sales data behaved as **white noise**, further time series modeling (ARIMA/SARIMA) was not appropriate.  
This project emphasizes **knowing when to stop analysis** as a crucial data science skill.
